# TITANIC_SURVIVAL_PREDICTION
Machine learning model for predicting the survivers on Titanic

Certainly! Here's an overview you could use for the README file on GitHub for a Titanic Survival Prediction project:

Titanic Survival Prediction
This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic. Leveraging historical data about passengers, the aim is to build a model that predicts whether a passenger would survive based on various attributes such as age, gender, ticket class, and more.

Project Overview
The Titanic Survival Prediction project uses a dataset comprising passenger information to explore, analyze, and predict survival outcomes. The project involves the following key components:

Dataset
The dataset used for this project contains details about passengers, including features like age, gender, ticket class, cabin, fare, and whether they survived or not.
It's used to train machine learning models to predict survival probabilities based on passenger attributes.
Analysis and Visualization
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to understand the distribution of features, correlations, missing values, and insights that might influence survival outcomes.
Visualizations, charts, and graphs are created to showcase trends, patterns, and relationships within the dataset.
Machine Learning Models
Various machine learning algorithms (like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.) are employed to build predictive models.
The models are trained, evaluated, and fine-tuned to achieve the best possible accuracy in predicting survival.
